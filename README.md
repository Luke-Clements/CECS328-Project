# CECS328-Project
Grade Progress Tracker

This project is intended to be used by students to help keep track of the GPA for their classes collectively and keep track of their grade in each class individually. In addition, the SQL user interface integration will allow students to easily input the class assignments and the grading scale for each class. Each class can have a maximum grade calculated so the student knows how they are doing in the class.
